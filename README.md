# Covid-Data-Analysis using R

Assembled and manipulated a COVID-19 dataset for African Countries(dataset is sourced from John Hopkins University COVID-19 project).We start by loading and analyzing the list of African countries and the available COVID data files. We then load the COVID data for October 2021, identify the matching African countries, and amend the list to extract necessary data. Next, we merge all datasets for the complete COVID-era by extracting date information from file names and creating a final dataset. We loop through the files, extract African countries' data, and merge it with the final dataset. The third part involves a time series analysis of COVID-19 deaths. We calculate death rates per 1 million population, identify the top 10 countries with the highest death rates, and create visualizations to show the death rate's growth over time. Lastly, we assess the data's reliability and provide recommendations for data collection and storage improvements. Additionally, we consider the US's position among the top 10 African countries based on COVID-19 data.
